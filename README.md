Okayy, so let's talk about how I come across when I try to communiate.

# **Voice:**

**Polite:**

I always try to be polite as much as I can. I think that anyone who's rude to others just reflects his own mental struggles to others. So being at least polite is essential.

**Not too serious:**

Even though I'm not trying to be all serious and formal, I still want what I say to carry some weight. I think it's about finding that sweet spot between fun and meaningful.

**Energetic:**

Nowadays I'm not that energetic, but normally I would say my voice was full of energy. And coffee was something like fuel for me.

# **Tone:**

**Natural:**

I like to sound less serious while still showing some respect. I'm always trying to balance professionalism with still trying to sound like myself and not trying too hard to sound like a salesman.

**Entertaining:**

When I'm writing something, I try to be a bit entertaining. I know it's hard to focus on some serious talk for a lot of people. So I try to entertain and say something a bit weird when things get too serious to break the ice.

**Optimistic:**

I would say that sometimes I tend to not react to bad things. Yeah, in my head, it's sometimes a big mess, but I try to sound optimistic and not cause panic.

# Style:

**Basic emojis:**

I use a few emojis here and there, but I'm trying not to overuse them. Just one "xd" or a heart emoji adds a nice touch without sounding too hyped and cringe.

**Minimal usage of capital letters:**

If it's just a single sentence, I'll skip capital letters. I wanna keep it easy and natural. I think sometimes it's better to show you haven't spent the last hour of your time responding to some message, so lowercase letters are essential for me.

**Simple vocabulary:**

I tend to simplify my vocabulary on purpose. It's more natural for me, and simple vocabulary sounds less like a salesman, like I said before. I sound more like a person talking to person, and there is not that barrier of professionalism between us. And yeah, sometimes it's better to use advanced words. It's not a rule. Just a basic principle of mine.
